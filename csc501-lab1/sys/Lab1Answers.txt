Q1] What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.

Answer 1]
-Exp-dist scheduler:
	Advantages		
		1. It solves the starvation problem by adding a degree of randomness.
		2. It allows preemption allowing another process to take over cpu. Preemption also allows for higher degrees of	 			  concurrency and better response time. 
		3. It gives the programmer a degree of freedom by adjusting the value of lambda to tune the distribution as per the needs.

	Disadvantages
		1. Process with highest priority may not get scheduled right away. This may be a problem in cases where the system is expected to 			  finish higher priority processes before others.
		2. The randomness adds a little non determinism. The exact behavior of the scheduler can only be aprroximated and not predicted.
		  
-Linux-like scheduler:
	Advantages
		1. It solves the starvation problem since each epoch will guarentee that every runnable process will run.
		2. The algorithm has dynamic preference of picking a process as goodness and quantum keep changing, so simply adding a process with 			   high priority to stall cpu will not affect performance significantly.
		3. The scheduling process is deterministic and the behaviour can be predicted given a sequence of input processes.
		  
	Disadvantages
		1. It consumes extra memory and also adds to extra cpu overhead. For a large number of processes the overhead will become 			   significant.
		2. No preemption. If a process gets a quantum, whatever the value, it runs its entire duration before giving away the cpu.
		3. If priorities are changed, they will not reflect till the next epoch. This makes the scheduler a little less robust to changes.

-Default Round Robin in Xinu:
	Advantages
		1. Easy to implement.
		2. Much less CPU overhead than other algorithms.
	
	Disadvantages
		1. Low priority processes may never get scheduled. There could be starvation.
		2. Total number of context switches for preemption is high. This will add to a higher context switch overhead.
		3. Each process gets the exact same quantum unless the yield the CPU. However, some proessses may need more CPU slices than others.

Q2] Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Answer 2]

Exp-dist scheduler will schedule the NULL process only when ready queue has no other process to run. The smallest random number generated is 0 and scheduler will try to pick something thats larger than 0. Whenever there is no process that fits the criterion, NULL process or NULLPROC is run for default quantum.
   
Linux-like scheduler will try to schedule NULLPROC when ready queue is empty. However since NULLPROC has goodness 0 and quantum 0, it won't run.
